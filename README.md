# thesis-multimodal-sign-translation

## About
This is a repository for linking resources for my graduate thesis, "Enhancing the accuracy of sign language translation by multimodalization with pose estimation".  
Since each resource is distributed in each repository, please refer to the resource list below.  

## Resources

### 1. Thesis Toolkit
This repository contains scripts that I have created myself.  
The purpose of each is mainly to analyze the features of the dataset, pre-processing (pose estimation in Mediapipe, data cleaning, etc.), and compile the result files.

### 2. I3D feature extraction
Forked by https://github.com/Finspire13/pytorch-i3d-feature-extraction .  
I have added a span-aware extraction process to the forked original I3D feature extraction implementation.

### 3. GASLT
Forked by https://github.com/YinAoXiong/GASLT .  
The code used in the experiment is stored in each branch.  

Experiment 1 was conducted entirely with code from this branch: https://github.com/HotaruK/GASLT/tree/reproduce  
See the respective branch for the implementation of Experiment 2.
